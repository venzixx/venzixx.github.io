        <p>Dear tiny human with the enormous heart,</p>
        <p>There aren't enough words in any language to express how grateful I am to have you in my life. You've shown me that the best things really do come in small packages, and that true strength isn't about size - it's about the courage to be authentically yourself.</p>
        <p>You've taught me to notice the little miracles that happen every day, to laugh more freely, and to approach life with the same wonder and enthusiasm that you bring to everything you do. Your presence is a gift that keeps on giving.</p>
        <p>On days when you forget how amazing you are, I hope you'll remember this: You are loved beyond measure, appreciated more than you know, and valued for exactly who you are. You don't need to be anything other than your wonderful, authentic self.</p>
        <p>Thank you for being the incredible person you are. The world is brighter because you're in it, and my life is infinitely better because you're part of it.</p>
        <p>With all my love and endless appreciation,<br>Your biggest fan 💕</p>
